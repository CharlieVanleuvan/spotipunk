# spotipunk
This is a data pipeline that extracts songs from the reddit forum r/poppunkers and then sends those song titles to Spotify to build a playlist.
This project aims to showcase how GCP Cloud functions can be used and orchestrated to extract song titles from Reddit's API and then send those titles to Spotify's API to curate and maintain a playlist.
